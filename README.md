# Hex Builder
## What is it?
A Hex Tile Building Toy

## Why I made it
Years ago, when I was first learning Unity, I attempted an mostly failed to make a game that was a mashup of the board games Catan, Carcassonne and Scrabble. I found that the most enjoyable part of that project, was the "Level Editor". This is a toy that mostly scratches that same itch, while being a much better made program, that could reasonably be extended to create other Hex Tile based games in the future.

## How to use it
